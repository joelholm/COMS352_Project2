Included in the zipped folder are 6 files
  alloc.cpp
  prov-rep.cpp
  res.txt
  semAndMem.h
  Makefile
  README.txt

To compile my code, enter 'make'.  Then to run, in different terminal windows enter './alloc' and './prov-rep.'

If the semaphore I'm using conflicts with another student's semaphore in pyrite, the key can be
changed in semAndMem.h:45.
